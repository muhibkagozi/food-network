            <p>It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver. When diet is
                wrong, medicine is of no
                use. When diet is correct, medicine is of no need.</p>

            <p>Grabbing a quick snack on your way to work is the new breakfast trend. Also, healthy home-made meals are
                replaced by easily available foods from your favourite fast-food joints. Kids these days prefer these
                foods and tend to fulfil their nutrition requirement. While it may be only satisfying for the tongue,
                there is very negligible nutrition value in these junk foods.</p>
